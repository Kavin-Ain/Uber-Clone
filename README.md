# Uber-Clone
A university project written in Java that I made in my Introduction to Computer Science II course during my first year. This clone mimics the functionability of Uber for both the user and the driver. This includes both delivery and ride-sharing services.
The clone reads from and writes to a list of users and drivers loacated in seperate .txt files
